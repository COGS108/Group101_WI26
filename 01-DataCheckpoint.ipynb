   "Professional soccer operates as a global labor market in which player valuations influence transfers, wages, sponsorship visibility, and long-term club strategy. Top European leagues generate billions of dollars annually in revenue, and transfer spending alone regularly exceeds several billion euros per season.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) In this context, how players are valued has real economic consequences for clubs, agents, and players themselves. Because actual transfer fees only materialize when a transfer occurs, researchers and analysts often rely on publicly available “market value” estimates as a consistent proxy for how the market rates a player at a given moment. These values allow large-scale cross-league and cross-season statistical analysis that would not be possible using transfer fees alone. \n",
   "\n",
   "A widely used public source of such estimates is Transfermarkt, which publishes crowd-informed market values. Transfermarkt explicitly distinguishes its estimates from realized transfer fees and describes its valuation process as combining pricing logic with structured, moderated community discussion.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This is crucial for our project: it implies that market value captures meaningful signals (age, contract status, performance, reputation) but may also reflect perception-based biases such as league visibility, media exposure, or hype. Thus, market value is best understood not as a “true” intrinsic worth, but as an observable outcome of a social and economic evaluation process. \n",
   "\n",
   "Prior academic research has investigated which factors explain player market value. A recent systematic review synthesizes evidence that performance metrics, age, positional role, contract characteristics, and contextual variables all contribute to valuation patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Müller et al. (2017) developed a data-driven framework to estimate market values across multiple European leagues and demonstrated that statistical modeling can reproduce meaningful valuation patterns using performance and contextual indicators.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Their work shows that valuation is partially predictable and structured, rather than arbitrary. \n",
   "\n",
   "However, much of the existing literature focuses either on specific subsets of leagues (e.g., top European competitions) or on predictive accuracy rather than interpretability. In other words, prior work often asks: Can we estimate market value? Our project instead emphasizes: Which measurable attributes are most strongly associated with market value in our dataset, and how do contextual factors compare to on-field performance? By focusing on interpretability within a regression-style framework, we aim to clarify the relative contribution of performance, demographic, and contextual predictors rather than maximizing prediction alone. \n",
   "\n",
   "Researchers have also documented structural effects that may influence valuation. For example, studies of relative age effects find that players born earlier in the selection year may have higher market values in youth contexts, suggesting that developmental structures shape perceived value.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) This highlights a broader concern: even when performance metrics are included, market value may embed selection effects and institutional bias. Additionally, competing “algorithmic valuation” proposals—such as those referencing CIES-style models incorporating age and contract length—demonstrate that valuation is multi-factor and contested, with no universally accepted formula.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) \n",
   "\n",
   "These prior studies motivate and delimit our contribution. Rather than proposing a new proprietary valuation model or claiming to identify a “true” player worth, our goal is to empirically examine associations between measurable player attributes (performance statistics, playing time, age, position, and league/club context) and publicly reported market value within our dataset. By situating our analysis within this broader literature, we treat market value as a socially informed economic signal and focus on interpreting patterns rather than asserting causal or normative conclusions. \n",

   "We hypothesize that season-to-season percentage changes in players’ inflation-adjusted market value (Transfermarkt, 2013–2023) are significantly predicted by age and standardized performance metrics, including goals per 90 minutes and assists per 90 minutes, after controlling for total league minutes played and primary playing position (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward). Specifically, we expect a nonlinear relationship between age and market value change (with younger players exhibiting larger positive changes), and a positive linear association between offensive performance metrics and market value growth.\n",
