    "Professional soccer operates as a global labor market in which player valuations influence transfers, wages, sponsorship visibility, and long-term club strategy. Top European leagues generate billions of dollars annually in revenue, and transfer spending alone regularly exceeds several billion euros per season.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) In this context, how players are valued has real economic consequences for clubs, agents, and players themselves. Because actual transfer fees only materialize when a transfer occurs, researchers and analysts often rely on publicly available “market value” estimates as a consistent proxy for how the market rates a player at a given moment. These values allow large-scale cross-league and cross-season statistical analysis that would not be possible using transfer fees alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used public source of such estimates is Transfermarkt, which publishes crowd-informed market values. Transfermarkt explicitly distinguishes its estimates from realized transfer fees and describes its valuation process as combining pricing logic with structured, moderated community discussion.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This is crucial for our project: it implies that market value captures meaningful signals (age, contract status, performance, reputation) but may also reflect perception-based biases such as league visibility, media exposure, or hype. Thus, market value is best understood not as a “true” intrinsic worth, but as an observable outcome of a social and economic evaluation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior academic research has investigated which factors explain player market value. A recent systematic review synthesizes evidence that performance metrics, age, positional role, contract characteristics, and contextual variables all contribute to valuation patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Müller et al. (2017) developed a data-driven framework to estimate market values across multiple European leagues and demonstrated that statistical modeling can reproduce meaningful valuation patterns using performance and contextual indicators.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Their work shows that valuation is partially predictable and structured, rather than arbitrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, much of the existing literature focuses either on specific subsets of leagues (e.g., top European competitions) or on predictive accuracy rather than interpretability. In other words, prior work often asks: Can we estimate market value? Our project instead emphasizes: Which measurable attributes are most strongly associated with market value in our dataset, and how do contextual factors compare to on-field performance? By focusing on interpretability within a regression-style framework, we aim to clarify the relative contribution of performance, demographic, and contextual predictors rather than maximizing prediction alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have also documented structural effects that may influence valuation. For example, studies of relative age effects find that players born earlier in the selection year may have higher market values in youth contexts, suggesting that developmental structures shape perceived value.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) This highlights a broader concern: even when performance metrics are included, market value may embed selection effects and institutional bias. Additionally, competing “algorithmic valuation” proposals—such as those referencing CIES-style models incorporating age and contract length—demonstrate that valuation is multi-factor and contested, with no universally accepted formula.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) \n",
    "\n",
    "These prior studies motivate and delimit our contribution. Rather than proposing a new proprietary valuation model or claiming to identify a “true” player worth, our goal is to empirically examine associations between measurable player attributes (performance statistics, playing time, age, position, and league/club context) and publicly reported market value within our dataset. By situating our analysis within this broader literature, we treat market value as a socially informed economic signal and focus on interpreting patterns rather than asserting causal or normative conclusions. \n",

    "We hypothesize that season-to-season percentage changes in players’ inflation-adjusted market value (Transfermarkt, 2013–2023) are significantly predicted by age and standardized performance metrics, including goals per 90 minutes and assists per 90 minutes, after controlling for total league minutes played and primary playing position (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward). Specifically, we expect a nonlinear relationship between age and market value change (with younger players exhibiting larger positive changes), and a positive linear association between offensive performance metrics and market value growth.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> This is relevant to our project because soccer player market values are not neutral measures of ability as they are affected by media exposure, league prestige, and subjective evaluation by clubs and analysts. As a result, the data may systematically overrepresent players from major European leagues, while undervaluing players from less visible leagues or countries, which may cause bias into any analysis that treats market value as an objective outcome.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that market value metrics may overlook non-quantifiable aspects of player contribution, such as leadership or tactical role. These limitations are considered when interpreting results and discussed explicitly in our analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We recognize the risk that results could be misinterpreted as objective evaluations of player ability. To mitigate this, we clearly state that findings are descriptive and context-dependent, and we discourage any real-world decision-making based on our analysis.\n"
