    "Professional soccer has become a global labor market where players are routinely assigned monetary values that influence transfers, wages, and long-term roster planning. While actual transfer fees are negotiated case-by-case (and only exist when a transfer occurs), many analysts use player “market value” estimates as a consistent proxy for how the market rates a player at a given moment. These estimates are widely used in sports analytics research because they are available for large numbers of players across many leagues and seasons, enabling statistical analysis of how age, performance, position, and context relate to value.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",
    "A common public source for market values is Transfermarkt, which publishes crowd-informed estimates that explicitly should not be treated as the same thing as transfer fees. Transfermarkt describes its values as being informed by “pricing models” and, importantly, by structured community discussion moderated through a market value process—meaning the output reflects human judgment as well as available data.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)  This matters for our project because it implies that market value can capture real market signals (age, contract situation, reputation) but may also reflect biases in perception (e.g., hype, league visibility). In our analysis, we treat market value as an observed outcome variable and focus on identifying associations with measurable player attributes rather than claiming a single “true” value. \n",
    "Prior academic work has examined which factors explain player value and how accurately values can be estimated from performance and contextual indicators. For example, Müller et al. (2017) developed a data-driven approach to estimate market values for thousands of players across multiple top European leagues and quantified the effects of numerous indicators (including performance and context), highlighting that systematic modeling can reproduce meaningful value patterns and that both on-field output and situational factors matter.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) This line of work motivates our approach of combining player performance statistics with demographic and contextual variables (age, position, league/club context) using regression-style models to interpret which predictors relate most strongly to market value in our dataset. \n",
    "Researchers have also studied potential biases and structural effects that can show up in valuations. For instance, work on relative age effects (advantages linked to being born earlier in a selection year) found associations between relative age and market values in youth players, suggesting that development structures can influence who is perceived as valuable.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) This is relevant to our ethics and interpretation: even if performance metrics are included, market value may embed selection effects and scouting biases. Additionally, there are competing “algorithmic valuation” efforts (e.g., CIES/FIFA-discussed models) that incorporate factors like age and contract length, underscoring that valuation is multi-factor and contested—there isn’t one universally accepted formula.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) These studies frame our project’s goal: to empirically test which measurable attributes (performance, playing time, age, position, contract proxies when available) are most associated with market value, while acknowledging that values may reflect both performance and perception. \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> This is relevant to our project because soccer player market values are not neutral measures of ability as they are affected by media exposure, league prestige, and subjective evaluation by clubs and analysts. As a result, the data may systematically overrepresent players from major European leagues, while undervaluing players from less visible leagues or countries, which may cause bias into any analysis that treats market value as an objective outcome.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

    "> We acknowledge that market value metrics may overlook non-quantifiable aspects of player contribution, such as leadership or tactical role. These limitations are considered when interpreting results and discussed explicitly in our analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",

    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",

    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
