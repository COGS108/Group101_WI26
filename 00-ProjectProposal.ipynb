    "Professional soccer operates as a global labor market in which player valuations influence transfers, wages, sponsorship visibility, and long-term club strategy. Top European leagues generate billions of dollars annually in revenue, and transfer spending alone regularly exceeds several billion euros per season.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) In this context, how players are valued has real economic consequences for clubs, agents, and players themselves. Because actual transfer fees only materialize when a transfer occurs, researchers and analysts often rely on publicly available “market value” estimates as a consistent proxy for how the market rates a player at a given moment. These values allow large-scale cross-league and cross-season statistical analysis that would not be possible using transfer fees alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used public source of such estimates is Transfermarkt, which publishes crowd-informed market values. Transfermarkt explicitly distinguishes its estimates from realized transfer fees and describes its valuation process as combining pricing logic with structured, moderated community discussion.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This is crucial for our project: it implies that market value captures meaningful signals (age, contract status, performance, reputation) but may also reflect perception-based biases such as league visibility, media exposure, or hype. Thus, market value is best understood not as a “true” intrinsic worth, but as an observable outcome of a social and economic evaluation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior academic research has investigated which factors explain player market value. A recent systematic review synthesizes evidence that performance metrics, age, positional role, contract characteristics, and contextual variables all contribute to valuation patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Müller et al. (2017) developed a data-driven framework to estimate market values across multiple European leagues and demonstrated that statistical modeling can reproduce meaningful valuation patterns using performance and contextual indicators.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Their work shows that valuation is partially predictable and structured, rather than arbitrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, much of the existing literature focuses either on specific subsets of leagues (e.g., top European competitions) or on predictive accuracy rather than interpretability. In other words, prior work often asks: Can we estimate market value? Our project instead emphasizes: Which measurable attributes are most strongly associated with market value in our dataset, and how do contextual factors compare to on-field performance? By focusing on interpretability within a regression-style framework, we aim to clarify the relative contribution of performance, demographic, and contextual predictors rather than maximizing prediction alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have also documented structural effects that may influence valuation. For example, studies of relative age effects find that players born earlier in the selection year may have higher market values in youth contexts, suggesting that developmental structures shape perceived value.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) This highlights a broader concern: even when performance metrics are included, market value may embed selection effects and institutional bias. Additionally, competing “algorithmic valuation” proposals—such as those referencing CIES-style models incorporating age and contract length—demonstrate that valuation is multi-factor and contested, with no universally accepted formula.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) \n",
    "\n",
    "These prior studies motivate and delimit our contribution. Rather than proposing a new proprietary valuation model or claiming to identify a “true” player worth, our goal is to empirically examine associations between measurable player attributes (performance statistics, playing time, age, position, and league/club context) and publicly reported market value within our dataset. By situating our analysis within this broader literature, we treat market value as a socially informed economic signal and focus on interpreting patterns rather than asserting causal or normative conclusions. \n",

    "We hypothesize that season-to-season percentage changes in players’ inflation-adjusted market value (Transfermarkt, 2013–2023) are significantly predicted by age and standardized performance metrics, including goals per 90 minutes and assists per 90 minutes, after controlling for total league minutes played and primary playing position (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward). Specifically, we expect a nonlinear relationship between age and market value change (with younger players exhibiting larger positive changes), and a positive linear association between offensive performance metrics and market value growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we hypothesize that nationality, operationalized as a categorical variable grouped by major footballing regions (e.g., Top-5 European leagues vs. non–Top-5 regions), will remain a statistically significant predictor in a multivariate regression model, reflecting differences in league exposure and market demand.\n"

    "  \n",
    "The ideal dataset would be a longitudinal player-level dataset that tracks professional soccer players across multiple seasons. Each row would represent a player–season observation, allowing us to analyze how player attributes and performance influence market value over time.\n",
    "For example, player attributes will include age, height, weight, nationality, preferred foot, position, contract length, injury history, team, and league. Performance variables per season will include goals, assists, minutes played, appearances, pass accuracy, and defensive metrics. It would also be useful to include market value variables such as transfer fee and wage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many observations are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce reliable statistical results, we would ideally need at least 10,000 player-season observations, with coverage across multiple leagues and seasons. It would be ideal to balance out the representation of player variables listed in the previous question. We need this to reduce bias towards some elite players, capture lower-value players, and adapt with model change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who/what/how would these data be collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset would be created by merging multiple reliable football data sources, such as Transfermarkt which provides market value over time, transfer fees, contract details, and career history. For performance statistics of each player, websites such as Kaggle and Opta would be useful since they provide match statistics, advanced metrics, and player ratings.  In order to merge these data, we would probably need to use unique player IDs, such as found on Transfermarkt and FIFA. \n",
    "\n",
    "* How would these data be stored/organized?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can store these data in a table with all variables. Table structure will be have each player in a single season in the first column, and other player attributes such as age, height, etc. will be listed in the further columns. We would also need to create additional tables such as team information table and transfer details table. We can combine these different table by linking each with player ID allocated to each player.\n",

    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
